    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chinese Dumplings JiaoZi, are nearly as ubiquitous as rice in Chinese cuisine. One of the major foods eaten during the Chinese Spring Festival, they look like the golden ingots  used during the Ming Dynasty for money. Coupled with the fact that the name sounds like the word for the earliest paper money, serving them is believed to bring prosperity.</p>
    <p>As a dish prepared at home, each family has its own preferred method of making them, using favorite fillings, with types and methods of preparation varying widely from region to region. This recipe is for the basic wrapper and filling, as well as our favourite dipping sauce — but definitely be bold and experiment with flavours. There’s no end to the types of dumplings that can be made.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g all purpose flour</li>
        <li>250 g ground pork</li>
        <li>200g chives</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>3 dashes ground white pepper</li>
        <li>Chinese cooking sherry</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a small portion (~1 tbsp) of the filling into the middle of each wrapper. Wet the edges of the dumpling with water. Fold the dough over the filling into a half moon shape and pinch the edges to seal. Repeat.</li>
        <li>Dust a clean surface with reserved flour, and turn out the dough. Roll the dough into a long cylindrical shape with a diameter of about 3 cm.</li>
        <li>When the water evaporates, remove the lid, check if the bottom of the dumplings have formed a nice golden crust. If not, let them cook uncovered a little longer. Place them on a serving plate, serve with dipping sauce.</li>
