    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Xiao Long Bao (小笼包), or soup dumplings, are a type of steamed dumpling from Shanghai cuisine (Jiangsu province for the greater region). In China, you will find there are many versions of soup dumplings that come in different flavors and sizes, but the most popular one is Xiao Long Bao. It features a paper thin wrapper filled with a very mild pork filling and a pocket of fragrant soup, served with a gingery vinegar dipping sauce.</p>
    <p>Xiao Long Bao is a type of dim sum that is traditionally enjoyed as a snack or during a meal as an appetizer or even a main dish. It’s certainly a complicated dish to make at home. But it’s such a great way to impress your guests if you’re hosting a dinner party.</p>
