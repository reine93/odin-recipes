    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Wonton is a type of Chinese dumpling. They come in small parcels and are available in many forms: steamed, deep-fried or in wonton soup.</p>
    <p>What is inside of a wonton? The inside contains a savory meat or seafood filling and a special yellow color and rectangle wrapper wraps the filling inside a wonton. The yellow color comes from egg yolk as wonton wrappers do contain eggs.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 lb. (0.2 kg) ground pork, chicken or turkey</li>
        <li>1/4 lb. (0.1 kg) shrimp, chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon soy sauce or fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 dashes ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1 pack store-bought wonton wrappers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the ground pork, shrimp, soy sauce, sesame oil and white pepper together. Stir to combine well to form a sticky filling.</li>
        <li>To wrap the wontons, lay a piece of the wonton wrapper on your palm and add 1/2 tablespoon of the filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Use 1 teaspoon filling if you are a beginner.) Dip your index finger into the sealing water and trace it on the outer edges of the wonton wrapper.</li>
        <li>Heat up some oil for deep-frying. Once the oil is fully heated, deep fry the wontons until golden brown. Drain the excess oil with paper towels. Serve hot with Chinese sweet and sour sauce or Thai sweet chili sauce.</li>
    </ol>
